50W Silver Jubilee Clone with independent gain controls.

Inspired by [SDM's Jubilee layouts](http://home.comcast.net/~mamp17/Jubilee%20Layouts.html) with redrawn schematics for layout, part reference and BOM purposes.

Actual physical layouts are **very** specific to the chassis and parts I used and should be treated as a reference only.

If in doubt, follow [SDM's Jubilee layouts](http://home.comcast.net/~mamp17/Jubilee%20Layouts.html) which are proven by many other builders!
