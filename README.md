50W Silver Jubilee Clone with independent gain controls.

Schematics and layouts developed with [KiCad](http://www.kicad-pcb.org).

Inspired by [SDM's Jubilee layouts](https://web.archive.org/web/20151026191650/http://home.comcast.net/~mamp17/Jubilee%20Layouts.html) with redrawn schematics for layout, part reference and BOM purposes.

Actual physical layouts are **very** specific to the chassis and parts I used and should be treated as a reference only.

If in doubt, follow [SDM's Jubilee layouts](https://web.archive.org/web/20151026191650/http://home.comcast.net/~mamp17/Jubilee%20Layouts.html) which are proven by many other builders!

Also see [original schematics](https://github.com/a-wai/ampfactory/blob/ba2dfc92f6a288e0c178695ec74adb9c7a02d9bf/non-free/Marshall/Silver%20Jubilee/Silver%20Jubilee%20-%202550.pdf) for reference.
